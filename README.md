# ABY 3 and Applications
 
## Introduction
 
This library provides the semi-honest implementation of [ABY 3](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/403.pdf) and [Fast Database Joins for Secret Shared Data](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/518.pdf).

The repo includes the following application:
 * Linear Regression (training/inference)
 * Logistic Regression (training/inference)
 * Database Inner, Left and Full Joins
 * Database Union
 * Set Cardinality
 * Threat Log Comparison ([see Section 5](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/518.pdf))
 * ERIC Application ([see Section 5](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/518.pdf))


Note that this is *not* the same implementation provided in the publication [ABY3: A Mixed Protocol Framework for Machine Learning](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/403.pdf), however it is very similar. Basicly a less optimized but more usable reimplementation by that was done for the database paper. If you wish to have the original ABY3 implementation, please contact the authors.

## Warning 

This codebase should **NOT** be considered fully secure. It has not had a security review and there are still several security related issues that have not been fully implemented. Only use this casebase as a proof-of-concept or to benchmark the perfromance. Future work is required for this implementation to be considered secure. 

Moreover, some features have not been fully developed and contains bugs. For example, the task scheduler sometime fails. This is a known issue.

## Install
 
The library is *cross platform* and has been tested on Windows and Linux. The dependencies are:

 * [libOTe](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe)
 * [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (networking)
 * [function2](https://github.com/Naios/function2)
 * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

### Windows

 1) Clone and build [libOTe](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe). 
 2) Edit `libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h` to contain `#define ENABLE_CIRCUITS ON`. 
 3) `git clone https://github.com/ladnir/aby3.git`
 4) `cd C:\`
 5) `mkdir libs`
 6) Download [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) to `C:\libs\eigen`.
 7) `git clone https://github.com/Naios/function2.git`  to `C:\libs\function2`.

Open `aby3.sln` in visual studio and build it. Note, you can place Eigen and function2 in a different location and update the aby3 project files to reference this location.

To see all the command line options, execute the program 

`frontend.exe` 


### Linux / Mac
 
In short, this will build the project

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe.git
cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux
bash boost.get
bash miracl.get
cd ../../..
cmake . -DENABLE_CIRCUITS=ON -DENABLE_SIMPLESTOT=ON
make -j
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/ladnir/aby3.git
cd aby3
cd thirdparty/linux
bash eigen.get
bash function2.get
cd ../..
cmake .
make -j
```

To see all the command line options, execute the program 
 
`./bin/frontend`


### Linking

 To use the library in your project, you will need to link the following:

1) .../libOTe
2) .../libOTe/cryptoTools
3) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/boost
4) .../aby3

and link:
1) .../libOTe/bin/liblibOTe.a
2) .../libOTe/bin/libcryptoTools.a
3) .../aby3/bin/libaby3.a
4) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/boost/stage/lib/libboost_system.a
5) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/boost/stage/lib/libboost_thread.a


**Note:** On windows the linking paths follow a similar pattern.
